        """
        Edges are normally treated as undirected and shared between faces. However, for some tasks (such as simplifying
        or cleaning geometry) it is useful to view faces as each having their own edges.
        You can think of this as splitting each shared undirected edge along its length into two half edges.
        (Boundary edges of course will only have one "half-edge".)
        Each half-edge is directed (it has a start vertex and an end vertex).

        The half-edge properties let you quickly find a half-edgeâ€™s source and destination vertex, the next half-edge,
        get the other half-edge from the same edge, find all half-edges sharing a given point, and other manipulations.

        Examples
        --------
        Get the half-edge's source

        >>> edge.origin

        Get the half-edge's destination

        >>> edge.target # or edge.twin.origin

        Get the previous and next half-edge

        >>> edge.prev
        >>> edge.next

        Get the other half-edge from the same edge

        >>> edge.twin

        Find all half-edges sharing a given point

        >>> edge.origin.connected_edges

        Parameters
        ----------
        incident_point: Point
            The cell point of which this edge is the border
        twin: HalfEdge
            The other half-edge from the same edge
        origin: Breakpoint or Vertex
            The origin of the half edge. Can be a Breakpoint or a Vertex during construction, and only Vertex when
            the diagram is finished.

        Attributes
        ----------
        origin: :class:`Breakpoint` or :class:`Vertex`
            Pointer to the origin. Can be breakpoint or vertex.
        next: :class:`HalfEdge`
            Pointer to the next edge
        prev: :class:`HalfEdge`
            Pointer to the previous edge

        breakpoint, which is a breakpoint between two moving arcs. In the latter case, we need to calculate the
        position based on the `y`-coordinate of the sweep line.

        Parameters
        ----------
